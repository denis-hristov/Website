            <p>Be memorable. If you're driving and see an ordinary cow, you won’t think much of it. But if you see a purple cow, you'll remember it and tell a friend. The same goes for business-stand out to stay in people's minds.</p>
            <p> - Your environment shapes you. The worst place to be is in a group where people are neither highly motivated nor completely lazy. It keeps you stagnant.</p>
            <p> - Focus beats multitasking. It’s better to concentrate on one thing and become an expert rather than run three businesses in different industries and not excel in any of them.</p>
            <p> - Scale matters. Small businesses struggle with every sale, while bigger companies make their entire monthly revenue in a single day.</p>
            <p> - Analyze and improve. After every 10 attempts, review what worked and what didn’t, and make the next 10 even better.</p>
